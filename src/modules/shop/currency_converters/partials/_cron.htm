<h4>Cron Updates:</h4>

<p><b>Enabling Cron :</b>To enable the cron feature your system scheduler must be set up to trigger the core cron process at an interval greater or equal to your selected update interval. Example command to add to your scheduler: <code>/usr/local/bin/php -q /ROOT/PATH/TO/SITE/public_html/modules/core/cron.php</code></p>
<p><b>Note:</b>
	When cron is enabled all rate updates will be handled by a background process.
	If not enabled the Currency Converter will check if new rates are required on every request. Requests are usually made on page load which can cause your site to hang if the conversion service becomes unavailable.
